package develop

// The package develop is used to host tools for development.
// The initial use case was to develop a "live-reload" solution for a golang web-application
// which relies on server-side html. The implementation is based on and copied from
// https://blog.markvincze.com/programmatically-refreshing-a-browser-tab-from-a-golang-application/
